* image is created withOUT VK_IMAGE_USAGE_SAMPLED_BIT nor VK_IMAGE_USAGE_INPUT_ATTACHMENT_BIT
* layout transition to VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL is executed

for a read-only storage image, set to VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL instead of the correct GENERAL.

Specification says this is not allowed:
"Load and store operations on storage images can only be done on images in VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_GENERAL layout."

API: vkCmdPipelineBarrier

specified by Valid Usage 00306 for vkCmdPipelineBarrier().

"If either oldLayout or newLayout is VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_* then image must have been created with VK_IMAGE_USAGE_*_BIT set"

00303   VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL          VK_IMAGE_USAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_BIT set
00304   VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL  VK_IMAGE_USAGE_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_BIT set
00305   VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_STENCIL_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL   VK_IMAGE_USAGE_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_BIT set
00306   VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL          VK_IMAGE_USAGE_SAMPLED_BIT or VK_IMAGE_USAGE_INPUT_ATTACHMENT_BIT set
00307   VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_TRANSFER_SRC_OPTIMAL              VK_IMAGE_USAGE_TRANSFER_SRC_BIT set
00308   VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_TRANSFER_DST_OPTIMAL              VK_IMAGE_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT set

goal: verify image's usages are correct for the barrier's layout
